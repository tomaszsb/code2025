# Active Player Highlighting Improvements

## Overview

This document details the implementation of enhanced active player highlighting in the Project Management Game. These improvements provide clearer visual feedback about which player's turn it is, improving the game's usability and player experience.

## Implementation Details

### Core Features Added

1. **Enhanced Visual Feedback**:
   - Pulsing animation for the active player's token
   - "YOUR TURN" text indicator that appears above the active player's token
   - Subtle animation effects for the player info card
   - Improved z-index management to ensure highlighting is visible

2. **Event-Based Update System**:
   - Custom events for turn changes and player position changes
   - EventTarget implementation for better component communication
   - Centralized active player state management

3. **Resource Management**:
   - Proper cleanup of timers and animations on component unmount
   - Optimized DOM manipulations with delayed execution
   - Error handling for all visual enhancements

   - Created "YOUR TURN" indicator styles
   - Implemented pulsing effects for player info cards
   - Added transition animations for smooth visual changes

3. **BoardSpaceRenderer.js**:
   - Added "YOUR TURN" indicator to player tokens
   - Updated the token rendering to support nested elements

4. **GameBoard.js**:
   - Added cleanup for TurnManager resources
   - Enhanced component unmount process

5. **MoveLogicUIUpdates.js** (Added April 29, 2025):
   - Implements additional "YOUR TURN" indicator functionality
   - Updates player token display based on turn changes
   - Adds CSS styles programmatically for visual indicators
   - Coordinates with TurnManager through the GameStateManager event system

### Coordination with MoveLogicManager

The active player highlighting is now coordinated between two components:

1. **TurnManager**: Handles the initial turn change events and basic player token highlighting
2. **MoveLogicUIUpdates**: Provides additional "YOUR TURN" indicators and enhanced styling

This dual-component approach ensures:
- Robust indicator display with redundancy in case one system fails
- Event-based coordination through GameStateManager
- Clear visual feedback from multiple UI elements
- Better separation of concerns for movement vs. turn management

The MoveLogicUIUpdates.js component (part of the MoveLogicManager inheritance chain) implements the following key methods for active player highlighting:

```javascript
/**
 * Initialize CSS styles for visual feedback
 */
initializeStyles() {
  const style = document.createElement('style');
  style.textContent = `
    .your-turn-indicator {
      display: block !important;
      position: absolute !important;
      top: -20px !important;
      left: 50% !important;
      transform: translateX(-50%) !important;
      background-color: rgba(255, 215, 0, 0.9) !important;
      color: #333 !important;
      padding: 3px 8px !important;
      border-radius: 10px !important;
      font-size: 10px !important;
      font-weight: bold !important;
      white-space: nowrap !important;
      box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2) !important;
      z-index: 100 !important;
      animation: bounce-in 0.5s ease-out forwards !important;
    }
    
    @keyframes bounce-in {
      0% { transform: translateX(-50%) translateY(10px); opacity: 0; }
      70% { transform: translateX(-50%) translateY(-3px); opacity: 1; }
      100% { transform: translateX(-50%) translateY(0); opacity: 1; }
    }
  `;
  document.head.appendChild(style);
}

/**
 * Update the current player token to show "YOUR TURN" indicator
 * @param {Object} currentPlayer - The current player object
 */
updateCurrentPlayerTokenDisplay(currentPlayer) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    try {
      // Find all current player tokens
      const currentPlayerTokens = document.querySelectorAll('.player-token.current-player');
      
      // For each token, add or update the YOUR TURN indicator
      currentPlayerTokens.forEach(token => {
        // Add the required CSS class for animation
        token.classList.add('active-player-enhanced');
        
        // Check if a YOUR TURN indicator already exists
        let indicator = token.querySelector('.your-turn-indicator');
        
        // If no indicator exists, create one
        if (!indicator) {
          indicator = document.createElement('div');
          indicator.className = 'your-turn-indicator';
          indicator.textContent = 'YOUR TURN';
          token.appendChild(indicator);
        }
        
        // Make sure the indicator is visible
        indicator.style.display = 'block';
      });
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('MoveLogicUIUpdates: Error updating player token display', error);
    }
  }, 300); // Delay to ensure DOM is rendered
}
```

### Technical Implementation

#### Event System

The active player highlighting now uses multiple event handlers:

1. **TurnManager**:
```javascript
handleTurnChanged(event) {
  // Update the current player's token
  const currentPlayer = window.GameStateManager.getCurrentPlayer();
  this.updateActivePlayerUI(currentPlayer);
}
```

2. **MoveLogicManager**:
```javascript
handleTurnChangedEvent(event) {
  // We may need to update available moves when turn changes
  const currentPlayer = window.GameStateManager.getCurrentPlayer();
  if (currentPlayer) {
    // Update the current player token display to show "YOUR TURN"
    this.updateCurrentPlayerTokenDisplay(currentPlayer);
  }
}
```

#### DOM Manipulation Approach

The implementation carefully handles DOM manipulation by:

1. Using setTimeout to ensure React has completed rendering
2. Using CSS classes instead of direct style manipulation
3. Implementing proper error handling for DOM operations
4. Cleaning up resources when components unmount

### User Experience Improvements

These enhancements significantly improve the game's usability by:

1. **Reducing Confusion**:
   - Players can immediately identify whose turn it is
   - The pulsing animation draws attention to the active player
   - The "YOUR TURN" text provides explicit feedback

2. **Creating Visual Hierarchy**:
   - The active player token has the highest visual prominence
   - Player info cards subtly animate to reinforce active status
   - Other players' tokens remain visible but less prominent

3. **Improving Flow**:
   - Transition animations make turn changes feel more natural
   - Enhanced visual feedback creates a more engaging experience
   - Subtle animations add polish without being distracting

## Integration with MoveLogicManager

The April 29, 2025 MoveLogicManager implementation enhances the active player highlighting with additional benefits:

1. **Improved Reliability**:
   - Two separate components handle YOUR TURN indicators
   - Each component uses different techniques for applying the indicators
   - If one approach fails, the other can still provide visual feedback

2. **Event-Based Coordination**:
   - Both components listen for turnChanged events
   - No direct component dependencies required
   - Clean separation of concerns between components

3. **Enhanced Visual Effects**:
   - MoveLogicUIUpdates adds bounce-in animation for YOUR TURN text
   - Improved z-index management ensures indicators are visible
   - Dynamic CSS styling avoids conflicts with other component styles

## Future Enhancements

While this implementation significantly improves active player highlighting, future enhancements could include:

1. **Consolidated Implementation**:
   - Move all active player highlighting to a dedicated ActivePlayerManager
   - Consolidate duplicate functionality between TurnManager and MoveLogicUIUpdates
   - Create a more centralized approach to visual indicators
   - **TODO:** Create an ActivePlayerManager that handles all highlighting functionality

2. **Customizable Animation Settings**:
   - Allow players to adjust animation intensity
   - Support reduced motion preferences for accessibility
   - Add animation settings to game options menu

3. **Sound Effects**:
   - Add optional audio cues for turn changes
   - Implement subtle sound effects for player movement

4. **Additional Visual Cues**:
   - Implement temporary path highlighting from previous position
   - Add directional indicators for possible move paths

## Conclusion

The implementation of enhanced active player highlighting addresses a key usability need identified in the project roadmap. By providing clear visual indicators for the active player, the game becomes more intuitive and engaging. The implementation follows best practices for performance and maintainability, using CSS classes for styling and proper cleanup of resources.

The coordination between TurnManager and MoveLogicManager creates a robust system for player turn indication, ensuring players always have clear visual feedback about whose turn it is.
