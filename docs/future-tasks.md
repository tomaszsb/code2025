# Project Roadmap and Planning

## Overview

This document consolidates the project's future direction, priorities, and timeline. It serves as the primary reference for development planning and resource allocation. The roadmap is organized by priority and timeframe to provide clear guidance on what to tackle next.

## Immediate Priorities (Next 2-4 Weeks)

### 1. Negotiation Mechanics Implementation
- Complete the implementation of the negotiation system
- Add UI components for negotiation decisions
- Integrate with dice roll system for retry mechanics
- Add appropriate visual feedback for negotiation states
- Test with multiple players and scenarios

### 2. Visual Feedback Enhancements
- Add animations for player movement between spaces
- Improve highlighting of the active player
- Add visual cues for available moves
- Implement transitions between game states
- Create consistent visual styling for different card types

### 3. Performance Optimization
- Reduce unnecessary re-renders in component tree
- Optimize complex calculations in MoveLogic
- Implement caching for frequently accessed data
- Improve loading time for CSV data
- Review and optimize localStorage usage

### 4. End Game Experience
- Implement proper game completion UI
- Add player statistics and performance metrics
- Create a replay option
- Add ability to review game history
- Design and implement win/loss conditions

## Medium-Term Goals (1-3 Months)

### 1. Component Refactoring
- Apply the same refactoring pattern used for cards to other large components
- Refactor GameBoard.js into smaller, focused components
- Extract utility functions for reusability
- Ensure consistent logging practices across all components
- Improve error handling and recovery

### 2. Educational Content Integration
- Add tooltips explaining project management concepts
- Integrate learning objectives with gameplay mechanics
- Create a glossary of project management terms
- Implement difficulty levels for different learning experiences
- Add reflection prompts after key game decisions

### 3. Testing Infrastructure
- Create a comprehensive test suite for core game mechanics
- Implement automated tests for component rendering
- Add integration tests for critical user flows
- Create a test plan for dice roll outcomes for balance
- Implement test coverage reporting

### 4. Multiplayer Enhancements
- Improve turn-based mechanics
- Add player interaction opportunities
- Implement catch-up mechanics for trailing players
- Balance resource distribution
- Add team play mode

## Long-Term Vision (3-6 Months)

### 1. Advanced Game Mechanics
- Implement risk management mechanics
- Add project stakeholder dynamics
- Create complex resource management challenges
- Develop scenario-based gameplay options
- Add industry-specific project types

### 2. User Experience Refinements
- Conduct usability testing and implement findings
- Refine the visual design system
- Implement accessibility improvements
- Add progressive disclosure of complex mechanics
- Create an onboarding tutorial

### 3. Content Expansion
- Add additional card types and effects
- Create more diverse space types and outcomes
- Develop advanced project management scenarios
- Add industry-specific challenges and solutions
- Implement a card creation system for instructors

### 4. Integration Capabilities
- Add API for integration with learning management systems
- Create data export for analytics
- Implement progress tracking
- Add customization options for educational settings
- Create an instructor dashboard

## Implementation Approach

When implementing these features, follow these guidelines:

1. **Incremental Development**: Build one feature at a time and test thoroughly before moving to the next
2. **Component Refactoring**: Continue breaking large components into smaller, focused ones
3. **Documentation**: Update documentation as features are developed
4. **Testing**: Write tests for each new feature before implementation
5. **Code Quality**: Maintain consistent coding patterns and avoid inline CSS

## Success Metrics

The success of this roadmap will be measured by:

1. **Completion Rate**: Percentage of planned features successfully implemented
2. **Code Quality**: Reduction in bugs and technical debt
3. **User Satisfaction**: Feedback from playtesting sessions
4. **Performance**: Improvements in loading time and interaction responsiveness
5. **Learning Outcomes**: Effectiveness in teaching project management concepts

## Review and Update Process

This roadmap will be reviewed and updated monthly to reflect:
- Completed tasks
- Changing priorities
- New insights from user testing
- Technical constraints discovered during implementation
