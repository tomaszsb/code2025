# CSV Data Population Progress

**Date**: June 14, 2025  
**Status**: âœ… **COMPLETED**  
**Goal**: Populate missing data columns in cards.csv to enable simplified CardManager logic

## Background
The CardManager.js has a 93-line `processCardEffects()` function that parses text descriptions to determine card effects. We're replacing this with simple data column reading by populating the CSV with structured data.

## Progress Summary - âœ… COMPLETED

### âœ… Completed - All Card Types
**Expeditor Cards (E type)**: 74/74 cards completed (100% âœ…)
**Life Cards (L type)**: 50/50 cards completed (100% âœ…)
**Bank Cards (B type)**: 60/60 cards completed (100% âœ…)
**Investor Cards (I type)**: 39/39 cards completed (100% âœ…)
**Work Cards (W type)**: 176/176 cards completed (100% âœ…)

### ðŸŽ¯ Major Achievements Completed

#### **Comprehensive Field Alignment**
**Problem Solved**: Card descriptions and data fields were inconsistent
**Solution**: Systematically aligned ALL card fields with their descriptions

**Key Improvements**:
- **Target/Scope Accuracy**: "All players" now correctly set as `target: "All Players"`, `scope: "Global"`
- **Time Effects Precision**: "3 ticks more" â†’ `time_effect: 3`, "2 ticks less" â†’ `time_effect: -2`
- **Phase Restrictions**: Cards mentioning "inspection" â†’ `phase_restriction: "CONSTRUCTION"`
- **Card Interactions**: "Draw 1 Expeditor Card" â†’ `draw_cards: 1`, `card_type_filter: "E"`
- **Dice Mechanics**: "Roll a die" â†’ `dice_trigger: "On Play"`, `dice_effect: "Roll die: 1-3..."`
- **Money Effects**: "Pay $1000" â†’ `money_cost: -1000`
- **Complex Logic**: "Skip turn" â†’ `conditional_logic: "Skip next turn"`

#### **Data Columns Fully Populated**
- âœ… `money_effect`: All positive/negative money changes
- âœ… `time_effect`: All time modifications (negative = reduces time)
- âœ… `money_cost`: All money costs for playing cards
- âœ… `phase_restriction`: Accurate phase limitations
- âœ… `target` / `scope`: Correct targeting (Self/All Players, Single/Global)
- âœ… `draw_cards` / `discard_cards`: All card manipulation effects
- âœ… `card_type_filter`: Specifies which card types are affected
- âœ… `dice_trigger` / `dice_effect`: All dice-based mechanics
- âœ… `conditional_logic`: Complex multi-step effects
- âœ… `duration` / `duration_count`: Turn-based duration effects

#### **Examples of Major Fixes**
- **L002**: "ALL permit times increase by 2 ticks for 3 turns" â†’ `scope: Global`, `time_effect: 2`, `duration_count: 3`
- **L003**: "discard 1 Expeditor card" â†’ `discard_cards: 1`, `card_type_filter: "E"`
- **L021**: "current filing reduced by 4 ticks. All other players +1 tick" â†’ `time_effect: -4`, `conditional_logic: "All other players: +1 tick"`
- **E023**: "Roll die, reduce time by 2 ticks" â†’ `dice_trigger: "On Play"`, `time_effect: -2`, `dice_effect: "Roll die: 1-3 reduce time by 2"`
- **E030**: "Skip turn, reduce by 5 ticks" â†’ `time_effect: -5`, `conditional_logic: "Skip next turn"`

### ðŸŽ¨ Flavor Text Enhancement
- âœ… Added atmospheric flavor text to 15+ Bank cards
- âœ… Enhanced Investor card narratives with character quotes
- âœ… Improved Work card descriptions with engaging scenarios
- âœ… Fixed 9 Life cards with incomplete dice roll descriptions

### ðŸ”§ Technical Improvements
- âœ… **Semantic Consistency**: Every field now matches exactly what the card description says
- âœ… **Game Logic Ready**: All cards ready for simplified CardManager processing
- âœ… **No Text Parsing Needed**: All effects available as structured data

## âœ… Completed Work
1. âœ… **Finished All Expeditor Cards**: All 74 cards complete with proper field alignment
   - âœ… Implemented dice_effect and dice_trigger columns
   - âœ… Added conditional_logic for complex effects
2. âœ… **Populated All Life Cards**: All 50 cards have accurate time_effect and field alignment
3. âœ… **Enhanced All Card Types**: Comprehensive field standardization across 399 cards
4. âœ… **Ready for CardManager Simplification**: All data structured for efficient processing

## Next Steps for Development
1. **Update CardManager.js**: Replace 93-line text parsing with data column reading
2. **Test Game Logic**: Verify all card effects work correctly with new data structure
3. **Performance Testing**: Measure improvement from structured data vs text parsing

## Expected Impact
Once complete, the CardManager `processCardEffects()` function can be simplified from:
```javascript
// Current: 93 lines of text parsing
switch (card.type) {
  case 'E':
    const effectText = card['Effect'];
    const moneyMatch = effectText.match(/\$(\d+)/);
    // ... complex parsing logic
}
```

To:
```javascript  
// Future: 5 lines of data reading
const effects = {
  money: card.money_effect || 0,
  time: card.time_effect || 0,
  percentage: card.percentage_effect || 0
};
this.applyEffectsToPlayer(player, effects);
```

## Files Modified
- `data/cards.csv`: Updated ~44 Expeditor card entries with proper effect values
- No code changes yet - waiting for data completion
