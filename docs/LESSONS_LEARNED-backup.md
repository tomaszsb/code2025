# Lessons Learned from Previous Implementations

## Code Organization Issues
- Large files were difficult to edit and maintain
- Too many interdependencies between components
- Complex loading sequences caused cascading failures
- Excessive error handling made debugging difficult

## What Worked Well
- CSV data-driven approach for game content
- The "snake" diagram board layout was visually effective
- Basic card structure was conceptually sound but implementation was complex
- Multiple player support basics were implemented

## Specific Components to Reference
- **Space Data Structure**: The CSV format in D:\Unravel\old_games\2025\01\01-04-2025 (working)\Data\Spaces Info.csv
- **Card Data Structure**: The card data files in D:\Unravel\Current_Game\Data\
- **Board Layout**: The CSS for the snake diagram in D:\Unravel\old_games\2025\01\01-04-2025 (working)\css\game-styles.css

## Implementation Strategies to Avoid
- Don't create complex initialization sequences with multiple dependencies
- Avoid creating manager classes that depend on other manager classes
- Don't add extensive error handling until core functionality works
- Don't modify multiple components at once

## Practical Implementation Steps
1. **Start with the board display and movement only**
   - Get the basic game board working first without worrying about cards, dice, etc.
   - Ensure the "snake" layout works properly
   - Implement simple player movement through spaces

2. **Add one feature at a time**
   - Only add a new feature when the previous one is solid
   - Test thoroughly after each new addition
   - Keep features as independent as possible

3. **Simplify state management**
   - Use a single GameState object to manage the overall game state
   - Minimize dependencies between different aspects of the game
   - Focus on making state changes easy to track and debug

4. **Emphasize visual feedback**
   - Always show clear feedback for player actions
   - Make game state changes visually obvious
   - Create intuitive UI for game interactions
