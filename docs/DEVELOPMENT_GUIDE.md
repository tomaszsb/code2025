# Development Guide

This guide provides information on the next development steps for the Project Management Game.

## Upcoming Priorities

1. **End Game Experience**:
   - Implement proper game completion UI
   - Add player statistics and performance metrics
   - Create a replay option
   - Add ability to review game history
   - Design and implement win/loss conditions

2. **Testing with Manager Pattern**:
   - Test refactored GameBoard with manager components
   - Validate interaction between managers
   - Verify all game functionality works with new architecture
   - Ensure no performance regressions with the refactored components

3. **Visual Enhancements**:
   - Implement transitions between game states
   - Create consistent visual styling for different card types

## Areas Needing Improvement

1. **Complex Initialization Logic**: 
   - Streamlining is needed in main.js initialization sequence
   - Consider implementing a staged initialization process
   - Add better error handling for initialization failures

2. **Debug Elements**: 
   - Need a debug mode toggle for console.log statements
   - Implement a logging level system (error, warn, info, debug)
   - Add UI toggle for debug mode

3. **Move Logic Complexity**: 
   - MoveLogic.js could benefit from more consistent patterns
   - Consider refactoring into a manager pattern
   - Improve documentation of complex move logic

4. **CSS Consistency**: 
   - Continue reviewing for variable reference issues
   - Standardize color schemes across components
   - Implement consistent spacing and layout rules

## Implementation Guidelines

When implementing these features, follow the standards outlined in each component's documentation and adhere to the established manager pattern. Refer to completed components like SpaceInfoManager and CardTypeUtilsManager as examples of proper implementation.

Always ensure:
- Proper event system integration
- Complete cleanup of event listeners
- Consistent logging
- No inline CSS
- Code follows the closed system principle

## Testing Recommendations

Prior to submitting any changes:
1. Test in multiple browsers
2. Verify mobile responsiveness
3. Check for memory leaks with extended play
4. Validate proper event cleanup
5. Ensure proper logging is implemented

## Documentation Requirements

Update the following for each change:
1. CHANGELOG.md with details of what was changed
2. Component documentation within the file itself
3. Any relevant player-facing documentation
