## ðŸ”§ **Critical Development Fixes (Historical)**

### **CSV Standardization and Movement Engine Fix (Post-Phase 4)**
**Issue**: After CSV standardization, three critical problems emerged:
1. Missing dice roll button on OWNER-SCOPE-INITIATION
2. Missing card pickup functionality  
3. Wrong next move (showing CON-INITIATION instead of OWNER-FUND-INITIATION)

**Root Cause**: Inconsistent CSV column mapping in GameStateManager after standardization

**Solution**: Fixed GameStateManager.js to properly map CSV headers to consistent snake_case properties

**Key Changes**:
- Fixed CSV column references for card data (w_card, b_card, etc.)
- Standardized all space movement data to use snake_case (space_1, space_2, etc.)
- Removed duplicate/inconsistent property mappings
- Ensured MovementEngine receives proper space data with space_1 = "OWNER-FUND-INITIATION"

### **End Turn Button and Space Display Issues (January 2025)**
**Issue**: After CSV standardization, End Turn button was not properly loading next spaces, and spaces would appear briefly then disappear

**Root Causes**: 
1. Property name mismatches: `currentSpace.name` vs `currentSpace.space_name` in MovementEngine
2. Space lookup inconsistencies: `space.id` vs `space.space_name` in UI components
3. Move ID vs space name mismatches in move selection
4. React setState race conditions overwriting `exploredSpace` state

**Solution**: Comprehensive property name standardization and state preservation

**Key Changes**:
- **MovementEngine.js**: Fixed all `currentSpace.name` references to `currentSpace.space_name`
- **TurnManager.js**: Fixed space lookup to use `space.space_name` instead of `space.id`
- **SpaceSelectionManager.js**: Fixed move validation and space lookups to use correct property names
- **BoardSpaceRenderer.js**: Fixed available move checking to use `move.name` instead of `move.id`
- **SpaceSelectionManager.js**: Fixed all setState calls to preserve existing state with spread operator

### **Worktype Card Scope Display Fix**
**Issue**: Worktype (W) cards were not displaying as scope in the current turn panel (StaticPlayerStatus component)

**Root Cause**: StaticPlayerStatus was using legacy field names for card properties

**Solution**: Updated field name mapping to match current CSV format

**Key Changes**:
- **StaticPlayerStatus.js**: Updated card type check to include both `card.type` and `card.card_type`
- **StaticPlayerStatus.js**: Updated work type field to use `card.work_type_restriction` with legacy fallback
- **StaticPlayerStatus.js**: Updated cost field to use `card.work_cost` with legacy fallback

### **State Management Race Condition Prevention**
**Issue**: Multiple React setState calls were overwriting important state like `exploredSpace`

**Solution**: Changed all setState calls to use function form with prevState spread

**Pattern Applied**:
```javascript
// Before (overwrites state):
this.gameBoard.setState({ availableMoves: [], showDiceRoll: false });

// After (preserves state):
this.gameBoard.setState(prevState => ({ 
  ...prevState, 
  availableMoves: [], 
  showDiceRoll: false 
}));
```

**Components Fixed**: SpaceSelectionManager event handlers and state updates

### **Property Name Standardization Rules**
Moving forward, all components must use:
- **Space Objects**: `space.space_name` (not `space.name`)
- **Move Objects**: `move.name` for space name, `move.id` for generated ID
- **Card Objects**: Both `card.card_type` and `card.type` for type checking
- **Card Fields**: Current CSV names (`work_type_restriction`, `work_cost`) with legacy fallbacks
- **React setState**: Always use function form with spread operator to preserve state

### **App.js State Management Fix**
**Issue**: Empty page after "Start New Game" due to incorrect state references

**Solution**: Updated App.js to use GameStateManager instead of legacy GameState

**Added**: Proper event listeners for game state changes and re-render triggers

### **GameStateManager Initialization**
**Added**: `gameStarted` getter property for proper state access

**Fixed**: Initialization flag setting when first player is added

**Enhanced**: Event-driven state updates for UI synchronization
