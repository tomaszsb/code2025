# Project Management Game: Current Status and Recommendations

## Current Implementation Assessment

After reviewing the codebase, I've identified several key aspects of the current implementation that provide a foundation for further development while also highlighting areas that need attention.

### Strengths
1. **Project Structure**: The folder structure is well-organized with proper separation of concerns (CSS, JS, data folders).
2. **Component Organization**: Components are separated into individual files with good encapsulation.
3. **Data-Driven Approach**: CSV files are used as the source of truth for game data (spaces, cards, dice outcomes).
4. **Advanced Movement System**: Complex movement between spaces is implemented with support for first and subsequent visits.
5. **State Management**: The GameStateManager provides optimized state management with efficient caching and persistence.
6. **Dice Roll System**: A fully functional dice roll system is implemented with 3D visuals, animations, and outcome categorization.
7. **Card System**: Card data structure, drawing logic, and UI implementation are complete with filtering, detailed view, and animations.
8. **End Game Detection**: The game properly detects when a player reaches the end space.
9. **Proper Code Practices**: Files include logging statements and avoid inline CSS as required.
10. **Component Refactoring**: Large components have been broken down into smaller, focused ones for improved maintainability.
11. **Manager Architecture**: Core components follow the manager pattern for better organization and responsibility separation.
