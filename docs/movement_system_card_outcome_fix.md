# Movement System Card Outcome Fix

## Problem Description

When a player rolls a dice and receives a card outcome (e.g., "W Cards: Draw 3"), the player becomes stuck on their current space and cannot select moves to continue. This happens because:

1. The card drawing functionality works correctly, but there are no available moves shown after drawing
2. The dice outcome contains `moves: Array(0)` with no valid destinations
3. The movement system doesn't properly handle the transition from card outcomes to movement options

## Solution Implementation

We've implemented a comprehensive solution that addresses all aspects of this issue:

### 1. MovementCore.js Modifications

- Added a critical check for `hasRolledDice` at the beginning of `spaceRequiresDiceRoll()`
- This prevents re-prompting for dice rolls after cards have been drawn
- The flag is now checked before any other dice roll requirement logic

```javascript
// First check if player has already rolled dice this turn
if (this.gameStateManager.hasRolledDice === true) {
  console.log('MovementCore: Player has already rolled dice this turn, not requiring another roll');
  return false;
}
```

### 2. DiceManager.js Improvements

- Refactored `updateGameBoardState()` to explicitly set `hasRolledDice` in both GameBoard state and GameStateManager
- Created a new dedicated method `updateAvailableMovesAfterDiceRoll()` with better fallback mechanics
- Implemented a three-tier approach for finding available moves:
  1. Use moves from dice outcome if available
  2. Get standard moves from GameStateManager if outcome moves aren't available
  3. Extract moves directly from space data as a final fallback

This ensures players always have movement options after drawing cards from dice rolls.

### 3. MovementUIAdapter.js Enhancements

- Added a specialized `handleCardOutcome()` method to manage movement after card draws
- Enhanced `handleDiceRollCompletedEvent()` to ensure proper state flags are set
- Modified the outcome type switch in `processDiceRollForUI()` to detect card outcomes

This creates a dedicated pathway for handling card outcomes, with delays to ensure cards are drawn before movement is attempted.

### 4. MovementLogic.js Updates

- Enhanced card outcome processing with additional data and flags
- Added `isCardOutcome` and `requiresFallbackMoves` flags to signal special handling needs
- Improved logging to track the source of moves in card outcomes

## How It Works

1. When a dice roll produces a card outcome:
   - DiceManager properly sets `hasRolledDice = true` in both GameBoard and GameStateManager
   - MovementLogic's `processDiceRollOutcome()` adds standard moves to the card outcome
   - MovementUIAdapter's `handleCardOutcome()` is called to handle the special case

2. The system then:
   - Waits a short period for cards to be drawn and processed
   - Updates the available moves for the player using standard moves from their current space
   - Implements fallback measures if no moves are found

3. When the player tries to move:
   - The system won't re-prompt for dice rolls (since `hasRolledDice = true`)
   - Available moves are properly displayed and become clickable
   - The game flow continues normally

## Testing

To verify this fix:
1. Create a test game with a player on a space that requires dice roll
2. Roll the dice and get a "W Cards: Draw 3" outcome
3. Confirm cards are drawn correctly
4. Verify available moves are shown and can be clicked
5. Complete a move to confirm the system works end-to-end

## Debugging Tips

If issues persist:
- Check browser console for "MovementUIAdapter: Updated available moves after card outcome" message
- Verify `hasRolledDice` is set to `true` in both GameBoard state and GameStateManager
- Look for log messages about the source of available moves
- Ensure the dice outcome includes the proper card type and action
