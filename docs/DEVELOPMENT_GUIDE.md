# Development Guide

This guide provides information on the next development steps for the Project Management Game.

## Upcoming Priorities

1. **Gameplay Mechanics Fixes**:
   - ✅ Fix movement issues for all spaces in MoveLogicManager.js
   - ✅ Implement card effects properly to ensure they introduce changes to the game state
   - Create a functional leaderboard to track player progress

2. **End Game Experience**:
   - Implement proper game completion UI
   - Add player statistics and performance metrics
   - Create a replay option
   - Add ability to review game history
   - Design and implement win/loss conditions

3. **Testing with Manager Pattern**:
   - Test refactored GameBoard with manager components
   - Validate interaction between managers
   - Verify all game functionality works with new architecture
   - Ensure no performance regressions with the refactored components

4. **Visual Enhancements**:
   - Implement transitions between game states
   - Create consistent visual styling for different card types

## Areas Needing Improvement

1. **Complex Initialization Logic**: 
   - ✅ Refactored main.js into InitializationManager following the manager pattern
   - ✅ Implemented a staged initialization process
   - ✅ Added better error handling for initialization failures
   - ✅ Added debug mode toggle and logging level system

2. **Debug Elements**: 
   - ✅ Implemented debug mode toggle for console.log statements via URL parameter (?debug=true)
   - ✅ Implemented a logging level system (error, warn, info, debug) via URL parameter (?logLevel=debug)
   - ✅ Added UI toggle for debug mode in Index-debug.html

3. **Move Logic Complexity**: 
   - ✅ Refactored MoveLogic.js into MoveLogicManager following the manager pattern
   - ✅ Implemented consistent patterns for special case handling
   - ✅ Added comprehensive documentation in MoveLogicManager.md
   - ✅ Fixed issues with movement functionality for all spaces (fixed May 2, 2025)
   - ✅ Card effects now properly affect game state during movement (fixed April 30, 2025)
   - ✅ Implemented improved visit type resolution for consistent handling (fixed May 2, 2025)
   - ✅ Implemented fully data-driven approach using CSV files instead of hardcoded special cases (fixed May 4, 2025)

4. **Component Modularity**:
   - ✅ Refactored SpaceInfo.js into smaller, focused modules (SpaceInfoDice.js, SpaceInfoCards.js, SpaceInfoMoves.js, SpaceInfoUtils.js)
   - ✅ Implemented browser-friendly module pattern using window objects instead of ES modules
   - ✅ Used prototype mixins for efficient code sharing
   - ✅ Improved maintainability with clear separation of concerns
   - ✅ Updated documentation to reflect the modular architecture (May 1, 2025)

5. **CSS Consistency**: 
   - Continue reviewing for variable reference issues
   - Standardize color schemes across components
   - Implement consistent spacing and layout rules

## Implementation Guidelines

When implementing these features, follow the standards outlined in each component's documentation and adhere to the established manager pattern. Refer to completed components like SpaceInfoManager, CardTypeUtilsManager, and MoveLogicManager as examples of proper implementation.

For large components, follow the modular approach demonstrated in the SpaceInfo component refactoring:
- Break up large components into smaller, focused modules
- Use browser-friendly module patterns with window objects
- Apply prototype mixins for method sharing
- Keep related functionality grouped in separate files
- Maintain clear documentation of the component structure

Always ensure:
- Proper event system integration
- Complete cleanup of event listeners
- Consistent logging (beginning and end of execution)
- No inline CSS
- Code follows the closed system principle

## Testing Recommendations

Prior to submitting any changes:
1. Test in multiple browsers
2. Verify mobile responsiveness
3. Check for memory leaks with extended play
4. Validate proper event cleanup
5. Ensure proper logging is implemented
6. Test specific spaces that had movement issues
7. Verify card effects are properly applied during gameplay
8. For modular components, test:
   - Proper module loading order
   - Correct application of mixins
   - Cross-module function calls
   - Browser compatibility
   - Console for module loading errors

## Documentation Requirements

Update the following for each change:
1. CHANGELOG.md with details of what was changed
2. Component documentation within the file itself
3. Any relevant player-facing documentation
