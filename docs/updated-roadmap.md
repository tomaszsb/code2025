# Updated Project Roadmap

## Project Overview
A digital board game that simulates the lifecycle of a construction project. The game is designed for educational purposes, targeting colleges and universities as a teaching tool for project management concepts.

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core Movement System
**Goal**: Create a reliable, playable board game with basic movement mechanics.

- **Tasks**:
  - [x] Create simplified board with connected spaces following the "snake" diagram
  - [x] Implement player token movement between spaces
  - [x] Add basic turn system that works with multiple players
  - [x] Create simple player setup screen
  - [x] Implement game state persistence (save/load)
  - [x] Add basic end game condition
  
- **Current Status**:
  - Board display and snake layout are fully implemented
  - Player movement is functional with support for first and subsequent visits
  - Turn system is working for multiple players
  - Player setup interface is complete
  - Game state persistence works with localStorage
  - End game detection and scoring is implemented

### Phase 2: Card System
**Goal**: Implement the resource cards that drive the game's economy.

- **Tasks**:
  - [x] Create card data structure and storage
  - [x] Connect card drawing to specific board spaces
  - [x] Implement basic card actions (draw, discard)
  - [ ] Create card display component that efficiently shows cards in player's hand
  - [ ] Implement expandable "card drawer" for detailed viewing
  - [ ] Create resource tracking for player stats based on cards

- **Current Status**:
  - Card CSV data is prepared and available
  - Basic card logic is implemented in GameState
  - Card drawing is connected to spaces in the game
  - Game tracks which cards to draw based on visit type and space
  - User interface for viewing and managing cards is not yet implemented

### Phase 3: Dice and Outcomes
**Goal**: Implement the dice rolling mechanism and connect it to game outcomes.

- **Tasks**:
  - [x] Create dice rolling mechanic
  - [x] Connect dice outcomes to space-specific results
  - [x] Implement branching path logic based on dice results
  - [x] Implement negotiation mechanic to retry outcomes
  - [x] Enhance negotiation mechanic with improved logging and code clarity
  - [ ] Balance outcome probability for engaging gameplay

- **Current Status**:
  - Dice rolling component is fully implemented
  - Space-to-dice outcome connections are working
  - Result-based movement options are implemented
  - DiceRollLogic utility manages outcome processing
  - Dice roll history is maintained
  - Integration with negotiation mechanics is pending

### Phase 4: Project Management Elements
**Goal**: Enhance the educational value by implementing project management concepts.

- **Tasks**:
  - [x] Define board spaces to represent project phases
  - [ ] Add educational tooltips explaining PM concepts
  - [ ] Implement realistic project constraints (time, budget, scope)
  - [ ] Create meaningful decision points that reflect real project challenges
  - [ ] Balance difficulty for educational value

- **Current Status**:
  - Board spaces represent project phases with appropriate categories
  - Basic time tracking is implemented
  - Educational content is defined in space descriptions
  - Game instructions panel is implemented
  - Further refinement of PM concepts is needed

### Phase 5: Polishing and Testing
**Goal**: Refine the user experience and gather feedback.

- **Tasks**:
  - [ ] Enhance visual design for clarity and engagement
  - [ ] Implement the "Pokedex"-style card reference system
  - [ ] Add basic animations and feedback
  - [ ] Conduct playtests with target audience
  - [ ] Create tutorial and documentation
  - [ ] Prepare marketing materials for educational institutions

- **Current Status**:
  - Basic styling is in place
  - Game flow is functional
  - More visual enhancements and user testing needed

## Current Implementation Status

### Completed
- Basic project structure is in place
- Game board rendering with snake layout
- Player setup and turn management
- Space navigation and movement
- Game state persistence
- First visit vs. subsequent visit logic
- Dice roll system for determining outcomes
- Card system data structure and integration
- End game detection and scoring

### In Progress
- User interface improvements
- Card display and management UI
- Testing and refinement of dice outcomes
- Educational content integration

### Challenges and Solutions
1. **Challenge**: Complex space navigation logic
   **Solution**: Created specialized MoveLogic utility to manage different space types

2. **Challenge**: Managing different visit types (first vs. subsequent)
   **Solution**: Implemented visit tracking in GameState and space-specific behavior

3. **Challenge**: Dice roll outcome processing
   **Solution**: Created dedicated DiceRollLogic utility and DiceRoll component

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Complete the card display UI to allow players to view and manage their cards
2. Refine the dice roll outcomes to ensure balanced gameplay
3. Add visual enhancements to make the game more engaging
4. Conduct testing sessions to identify any bugs or usability issues
5. Document the technical architecture to aid future development

## Success Criteria Update
- [x] Players can play through a complete game from start to finish
- [x] The board movement system works reliably
- [x] Multiple players can take turns effectively
- [x] Game state persists when refreshing the page
- [x] End game condition is properly detected
- [ ] Players can view and manage their cards
- [ ] The game provides meaningful educational content about project management

This updated roadmap reflects the current state of the project and provides a clear path forward for development. The focus should be on completing the user interface for the card system, refining the dice roll outcomes, and enhancing the educational value of the game.
