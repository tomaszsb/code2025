# Movement System Card Outcome Fix - Status Update

## Status: Issues Remain Unresolved

Our attempted fix for the move click after card draw issue did not resolve the problem. The initial approach aimed to address the following:

1. Ensuring proper handling of the `hasRolledDice` flag between components
2. Adding specialized card outcome handling in MovementUIAdapter
3. Implementing robust fallback mechanisms for finding available moves
4. Enhancing MovementLogic to better process card outcomes

However, implementation issues have prevented successful resolution:

1. A syntax error in DiceManager.js (comma after method definition) was fixed
2. Despite this fix, core functionality issues still persist
3. Further debugging and a more comprehensive approach will be needed

## Next Steps

We will continue addressing this issue in a new troubleshooting session, focusing on:

1. Deeper analysis of the interactions between card drawing and movement systems
2. Examining the event sequence when cards are drawn from dice outcomes
3. Directly inspecting the state management during this critical transition
4. Considering alternative architectural approaches if necessary

## Original Implementation Plan (For Reference)

The original approach involved:

### MovementCore.js Modifications
- Adding `hasRolledDice` check at the beginning of dice roll requirement checks

### DiceManager.js Improvements
- Refactoring state management to properly handle card outcomes
- Creating tiered fallback mechanisms for finding moves

### MovementUIAdapter.js Enhancements
- Adding specialized card outcome handling
- Ensuring proper timing of move updates after card draws

### MovementLogic.js Updates
- Enhancing card outcome metadata
- Improving move accessibility after card draws
