## üîß **Known Issues & Troubleshooting**

### **Critical Issues**
- **Player Name Display Bug**: Names may show as "Player 1Alice" instead of "Alice" (visual bug only)
- **JavaScript Stack Overflow**: May occur during gameplay causing browser freezing - refresh page if encountered
- **Movement Mechanics**: Clicking spaces highlights but may not move player - use "End Turn" button to confirm moves

### **Setup Issues**
- **Game Won't Load**: Must use HTTP server, not direct file opening
- **Blank Screen**: Game may show brief blank screen after "Start Game" - wait 2-3 seconds for loading
- **Module Loading Errors**: Ensure all JavaScript files are accessible via HTTP server

### **Gameplay Issues**
- **Infinite Loops**: If game becomes unresponsive, refresh page and restart
- **Card System**: Some card interactions may trigger stack overflow errors
- **Movement**: Use available move buttons and "End Turn" to confirm moves
