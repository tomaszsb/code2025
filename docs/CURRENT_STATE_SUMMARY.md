# Current State Summary - December 2024

## What We Just Did

### CSV Improvements (Phase 1 - In Progress)
1. **Added Path Column** to Spaces.csv
   - Values: Main, Special, Side quest money, Side quest scope, Side quest cheat
   - Replaces hardcoded lists in JavaScript

2. **Added RequiresDiceRoll Column** to Spaces.csv
   - Values: Yes/No for each space
   - Code already existed to use this column

3. **Replaced "RETURN TO YOUR SPACE"** with `{ORIGINAL_SPACE}`
   - In PM-DECISION-CHECK subsequent visit (Space 4)
   - Game now interprets this placeholder

### Code Changes
1. **MovementCore.js**
   - Tracks space paths using new Path column
   - Stores originalSpaceId when player moves from Main to Side quest
   - Uses Path column to determine main path history

2. **MovementLogic.js**
   - Detects `{ORIGINAL_SPACE}` placeholder
   - Replaces it with actual moves from stored original space
   - Adds "Return to main path:" prefix to these moves

3. **SpaceInfoMoves.js**
   - Uses Path column instead of hardcoded space lists
   - Simplified side quest detection logic

### Documentation Updates
1. **Created FILE_STRUCTURE_REORGANIZATION.md**
   - Plan to clean up confusing util folders
   - Phased approach to reorganization

2. **Updated CSV_FORMAT_IMPROVEMENTS_IMPLEMENTATION.md**
   - Corrected false claim that Phase 1 was completed
   - Now accurately shows Phase 1 in progress

3. **Updated Memory Nodes**
   - Captured current state and approach
   - Fixed documentation/reality mismatches

## Current Focus

**PM-DECISION-CHECK Movement Fix**
- Players should be able to return to main path after side quests
- Using `{ORIGINAL_SPACE}` placeholder approach
- Testing needed to verify it works correctly

## Next Steps

1. **Test Current Implementation**
   - Verify PM-DECISION-CHECK shows correct moves
   - Check that {ORIGINAL_SPACE} is properly replaced
   - Ensure path tracking works correctly

2. **Fix Any Issues**
   - Debug based on test results
   - Adjust code as needed

3. **Continue File Reorganization**
   - Start with Phase 2: Move movement files
   - Update references gradually

4. **Complete CSV Phase 1**
   - Verify all spaces use RequiresDiceRoll correctly
   - Document completion properly

## Key Files Modified

- `data/Spaces.csv` - Added Path and RequiresDiceRoll columns
- `js/utils/movement/MovementCore.js` - Path tracking
- `js/utils/movement/MovementLogic.js` - {ORIGINAL_SPACE} handling
- `js/components/SpaceInfoMoves.js` - Simplified logic
- `docs/CSV_FORMAT_IMPROVEMENTS_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Reality check
- `docs/FILE_STRUCTURE_REORGANIZATION.md` - New plan

## Testing Commands

```javascript
// Check current player's state
GameStateManager.getCurrentPlayer().properties

// Check space paths
GameStateManager.spaces.find(s => s.name === "PM-DECISION-CHECK").Path

// Debug movement
GameStateManager.getAvailableMoves()
```
