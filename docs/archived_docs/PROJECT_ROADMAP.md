# Project Management Game: Roadmap and Status

## Current Status

The Project Management Game has made significant progress with numerous features implemented and optimized. This document outlines the current state of the project, upcoming priorities, and long-term vision.

### Current Implementation Assessment

After reviewing the codebase, we've identified key strengths and areas for improvement:

#### Strengths
1. **Project Structure**: Well-organized folder structure with proper separation of concerns.
2. **Component Organization**: Components are separated into individual files with good encapsulation.
3. **Data-Driven Approach**: CSV files are used as the source of truth for game data.
4. **Advanced Movement System**: Complex movement between spaces is implemented with support for first and subsequent visits.
5. **State Management**: The GameStateManager provides optimized state management with efficient caching and persistence.
6. **Dice Roll System**: A fully functional dice roll system is implemented with 3D visuals, animations, and outcome categorization.
7. **Card System**: Card data structure, drawing logic, and UI implementation are complete.
8. **End Game Detection**: The game properly detects when a player reaches the end space.
9. **Manager Architecture**: Core components follow the manager pattern for better organization.

#### Recent Achievements

1. **SpaceExplorer Performance Optimization**:
   - Implemented memoized data processing to avoid redundant calculations
   - Added performance tracking with render count and timing metrics
   - Enhanced error handling with stack trace and component stack logging
   - Improved null checking throughout the component to prevent rendering errors

2. **GameStateManager Implementation**:
   - Converted global GameState object to class-based GameStateManager 
   - Implemented high-performance caching for space lookups using Map data structures
   - Optimized visited spaces tracking with Set data structure for O(1) lookups
   - Created a robust event system for state changes with standardized event types

3. **Game Memory Management Enhancement**:
   - Implemented improved memory management with user-friendly options
   - When starting the game, it now checks for saved game data in localStorage
   - If a saved game exists, players can choose to continue or start a new game

4. **Enhanced Dice Roll System**:
   - All dice-related CSS has been extracted to a dedicated dice-animations.css file
   - CSS selectors have been properly scoped to prevent styling conflicts
   - Strict data adherence implemented: spaces only show dice outcomes if explicitly defined in CSV

5. **Card UI and System Implementation**:
   - The card system has been fully implemented with display, filtering, and interaction
   - Card effects are fully integrated with dice outcomes for automatic drawing
   - Interactive card interface provides clear visual feedback when drawing cards

6. **Component Refactoring**:
   - The GameBoard.js component has been refactored into a core component with manager classes
   - TurnManager, SpaceSelectionManager, and SpaceExplorerManager handle specific responsibilities
   - Large components have been broken down into smaller, focused ones for improved maintainability

7. **Visual Improvements**:
   - Player movement animations implemented with arrival and departure effects
   - Enhanced active player highlighting with pulsing effects and "YOUR TURN" indicator
   - Enhanced visual cues for available moves with pulsing animation and indicators
   - Fixed CSS variable reference errors and improved overall UI consistency

8. **Event System Integration Progress**:
   - Successfully refactored multiple managers to use the GameStateManager event system
   - Created custom event types for player movement, turn transitions, and active player changes
   - Implemented comprehensive cleanup methods for proper event listener management

#### Areas for Improvement

1. **Complex Initialization Logic**: 
   - The initialization sequence in main.js includes multiple layers of error handling and checks.
   - This complexity could make debugging more difficult.

2. **Debug Elements**:
   - There are numerous console.log statements throughout the code.
   - A debug mode could be implemented to toggle logs.

3. **Move Logic Complexity**:
   - The MoveLogic.js file contains complex special case handling for different spaces.
   - A more unified approach to space handling could be beneficial.

4. **Documentation Gaps**:
   - Additional technical documentation could still be improved for complex features.

5. **Event System Standardization**:
   - SpaceExplorer has been optimized but not yet converted to use the event system
   - A consistent pattern for event registration and cleanup is needed

## Implementation Approach

When implementing these features, follow these guidelines:

1. **Manager Pattern**: Apply the manager component pattern for new features
2. **Incremental Development**: Build one feature at a time and test thoroughly before moving to the next
3. **Component Refactoring**: Continue breaking large components into smaller, focused ones
4. **Documentation**: Update documentation as features are developed
5. **Testing**: Write tests for each new feature before implementation
6. **Code Quality**: Maintain consistent coding patterns and avoid inline CSS
7. **Event System**: Use the GameStateManager event system instead of direct state manipulation
8. **Resource Cleanup**: Always add cleanup methods to properly remove event listeners

## Success Metrics

The success of this roadmap will be measured by:

1. **Completion Rate**: Percentage of planned features successfully implemented
2. **Code Quality**: Reduction in bugs and technical debt
3. **User Satisfaction**: Feedback from playtesting sessions
4. **Performance**: Improvements in loading time and interaction responsiveness
5. **Learning Outcomes**: Effectiveness in teaching project management concepts

## Next Milestone

The next priority milestone is to:
- Refactor SpaceExplorerManager to use the GameStateManager event system
- Begin implementing the End Game Experience features

This will complete the standardization of the event system across all components and enable progression to the End Game Experience, which is critical for completing the core gameplay loop.
