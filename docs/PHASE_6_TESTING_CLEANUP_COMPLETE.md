   - Verified combo pattern parsing works correctly
   - Tested combo satisfaction detection
   - Confirmed bonus effect calculation

3. **Test chain reaction mechanics**
   - Tested chain effect parsing for patterns like `draw:B->if:money>200000->draw:W`
   - Verified conditional logic evaluation (money>X, time<X)
   - Tested special trigger effects (bonus_turn, double_next)
   - Confirmed chain command execution sequence

### âœ… Medium Priority Tasks

4. **Test multi-card interaction system**
   - Verified synergy detection (Bank+Investor, Work+Life, Full Spectrum)
   - Tested conflict detection (resource, targeting, timing conflicts)
   - Confirmed amplification effects work correctly
   - Validated interaction history tracking

5. **Test complex targeting system**
   - Tested compound targeting (`All Players-Self`)
   - Verified conditional targeting (`Player:money>100000`)
   - Confirmed alternative targeting patterns
   - Validated range and filter restrictions

6. **Add sample combo and chain data to CSV for testing**
   - Added 6 test cards with diverse Phase 5 features:
     - **TEST001:** Simple combo (B+I)
     - **TEST002:** Chain with condition
     - **TEST003:** Complex combo (2xW+B+I)
     - **TEST004:** Complex targeting + chain trigger
     - **TEST005:** Work-Life combo
     - **TEST006:** Advanced chain with multiple effects

### âœ… Low Priority Tasks

7. **Clean up unused code and debug statements**
   - Removed broken stub file: `MovementEngine_BROKEN_STUB.js`
   - Verified no critical debug statements remain
   - Confirmed code quality and organization
   - Maintained necessary logging for development

8. **Update documentation for new card system features**
   - Created comprehensive documentation: `PHASE_5_CARD_SYSTEM_FEATURES.md`
   - Updated main `CLAUDE.md` with Phase 5 feature summary
   - Documented all new CSV fields and patterns
   - Included usage examples and integration points
