# Phase 5: Advanced Card System Features

**Status: COMPLETED âœ…**  
**Implementation Date:** Phase 5 of Card System Migration  
**Files Modified:** CardManager.js, csv-parser.js, InitializationManager.js, GameStateManager.js

## Overview

Phase 5 introduces advanced card mechanics that transform the game from simple individual card effects to a sophisticated interaction system. This phase implements combo systems, chain reactions, multi-card synergies, complex targeting, and performance optimizations.

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Features Implemented

### 1. Card Combo System

**Purpose:** Enable cards to work together for enhanced effects when played in specific combinations.

**Implementation:**
- **Combo Requirements:** Cards can specify requirements like `B+I`, `2xW+B+I`, `3xW`
- **Pattern Parsing:** Advanced parser handles complex combo patterns
- **Combo Detection:** Automatic detection when players have the right cards
- **Bonus Effects:** Combos provide bonus money, time, and special effects

**Example Combos:**
- `B+I` (Bank + Investor): Enhanced financial terms bonus
- `2xW+B+I` (2 Work + Bank + Investor): Major project coordination bonus
- `W+L` (Work + Life): Work-life balance bonus

**CSV Fields:**
- `combo_requirement`: Pattern like "B+I" or "2xW+B+I"

**Code Location:** CardManager.js lines 634-851

### 2. Chain Reaction System

**Purpose:** Enable cards to trigger cascading effects based on game conditions.

**Implementation:**
- **Chain Effects:** Cards can specify chain patterns like `draw:B->if:money>200000->draw:W`
- **Conditional Logic:** Chains evaluate conditions before proceeding
- **Trigger Effects:** Special triggers like `bonus_turn`, `double_next`
- **Chain History:** Track chain executions for statistics

**Chain Commands:**
- `draw:X` - Draw a card of type X
- `if:condition` - Evaluate condition (money>X, time<X, etc.)
- `trigger:effect` - Trigger special effect

**CSV Fields:**
- `chain_effect`: Pattern like "draw:W->if:money>100000->draw:B"

**Code Location:** CardManager.js lines 880-1011

### 3. Multi-Card Interaction System

**Purpose:** Create rich interactions between multiple cards beyond just combos.

**Implementation:**
- **Synergy Detection:** Automatic detection of beneficial card combinations
- **Conflict Detection:** Identify incompatible cards or resource conflicts
- **Amplification Effects:** Cards can amplify other cards' effects
- **Interaction History:** Track all multi-card interactions

**Synergy Types:**
- **Finance Synergy:** Bank + Investor cards enhance each other
- **Work-Life Synergy:** Work + Life cards provide balance bonuses
- **Expeditor Synergy:** Expeditor cards amplify other card effects
- **Phase Synergy:** Cards from same phase work better together
- **Full Spectrum:** Playing all 5 card types provides mastery bonus

**Code Location:** CardManager.js lines 1017-1432

### 4. Complex Targeting System

**Purpose:** Enable sophisticated targeting patterns for card effects.

**Implementation:**
- **Compound Targeting:** Patterns like `All Players-Self`, `Self+Adjacent`
- **Conditional Targeting:** Patterns like `Player:money>100000`, `Opponent:behind`
- **Alternative Targeting:** Patterns like `Choose Player|Random Player`
- **Targeting Filters:** Range, line of sight, immunity checks
- **Target Validation:** Min/max target requirements

**Targeting Types:**
- **Basic:** Self, All Players, Choose Player, etc.
- **Positional:** Leading Player, Trailing Player, Adjacent Players
- **Conditional:** Player:money>X, Opponent:behind, Player:cards>=3
- **Compound:** All Players-Self, Self+Adjacent

**CSV Fields:**
- `target`: Complex targeting pattern
- `target_range`: Range restrictions
- `min_targets`, `max_targets`: Target count limits

**Code Location:** CardManager.js lines 442-899

### 5. Performance Optimization System

**Purpose:** Provide fast lookups and efficient processing for large card datasets.

**Implementation:**
- **Advanced Indexing:** Multi-dimensional indexes for cards
- **Fast Lookups:** O(1) lookup times for combo/chain opportunities
- **Performance Monitoring:** Built-in timing and metrics
- **Memory Optimization:** Efficient data structures

**Index Types:**
- `byType`: Index by card type (B, W, I, L, E)
- `byCombo`: Index by combo requirements
- `byChain`: Index by chain effects
- `byTarget`: Index by target types
- `byEffect`: Index by effect types
- `comboPairs`: Cards that work well together
- `chainTriggers`: Cards that can trigger chains

**Code Location:** csv-parser.js lines 260-555

## ðŸ“Š CSV Data Structure

### New Fields Added for Phase 5

| Field | Purpose | Example Values |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| `combo_requirement` | Combo pattern | `B+I`, `2xW+B+I`, `3xW` |
| `chain_effect` | Chain commands | `draw:B->if:money>200000->draw:W` |
| `target_range` | Range restrictions | `unlimited`, `2`, `adjacent` |
| `min_targets` | Minimum targets | `1`, `2` |
