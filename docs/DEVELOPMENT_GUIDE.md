# Development Guide

This guide provides information on the next development steps for the Project Management Game.

## Upcoming Priorities

1. **Gameplay Mechanics Fixes**:
   - Fix movement issues for all spaces in MoveLogicManager.js
   - Implement card effects properly to ensure they introduce changes to the game state
   - Create a functional leaderboard to track player progress

2. **End Game Experience**:
   - Implement proper game completion UI
   - Add player statistics and performance metrics
   - Create a replay option
   - Add ability to review game history
   - Design and implement win/loss conditions

3. **Testing with Manager Pattern**:
   - Test refactored GameBoard with manager components
   - Validate interaction between managers
   - Verify all game functionality works with new architecture
   - Ensure no performance regressions with the refactored components

4. **Visual Enhancements**:
   - Implement transitions between game states
   - Create consistent visual styling for different card types

## Areas Needing Improvement

1. **Complex Initialization Logic**: 
   - ✅ Refactored main.js into InitializationManager following the manager pattern
   - ✅ Implemented a staged initialization process
   - ✅ Added better error handling for initialization failures
   - ✅ Added debug mode toggle and logging level system

2. **Debug Elements**: 
   - ✅ Implemented debug mode toggle for console.log statements via URL parameter (?debug=true)
   - ✅ Implemented a logging level system (error, warn, info, debug) via URL parameter (?logLevel=debug)
   - ✅ Added UI toggle for debug mode in Index-debug.html

3. **Move Logic Complexity**: 
   - ✅ Refactored MoveLogic.js into MoveLogicManager following the manager pattern
   - ✅ Implemented consistent patterns for special case handling
   - ✅ Added comprehensive documentation in MoveLogicManager.md
   - Issues with movement functionality for certain spaces need to be fixed
   - Card effects don't properly affect game state during movement

4. **CSS Consistency**: 
   - Continue reviewing for variable reference issues
   - Standardize color schemes across components
   - Implement consistent spacing and layout rules

## Implementation Guidelines

When implementing these features, follow the standards outlined in each component's documentation and adhere to the established manager pattern. Refer to completed components like SpaceInfoManager, CardTypeUtilsManager, and MoveLogicManager as examples of proper implementation.

Always ensure:
- Proper event system integration
- Complete cleanup of event listeners
- Consistent logging
- No inline CSS
- Code follows the closed system principle

## Testing Recommendations

Prior to submitting any changes:
1. Test in multiple browsers
2. Verify mobile responsiveness
3. Check for memory leaks with extended play
4. Validate proper event cleanup
5. Ensure proper logging is implemented
6. Test specific spaces that had movement issues
7. Verify card effects are properly applied during gameplay

## Documentation Requirements

Update the following for each change:
1. CHANGELOG.md with details of what was changed
2. Component documentation within the file itself
3. Any relevant player-facing documentation
