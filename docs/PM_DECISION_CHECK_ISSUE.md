# PM-DECISION-CHECK Move Problem Technical Note - RESOLVED

## Original Issue Description
When a player landed on the PM-DECISION-CHECK space, they should see two sets of available moves:
1. The standard moves defined for PM-DECISION-CHECK (LEND-SCOPE-CHECK, ARCH-INITIATION, CHEAT-BYPASS, OWNER-DECISION-REVIEW)
2. The moves from their original space (the space they were on before moving to PM-DECISION-CHECK)

Previously, only the standard moves were shown, which prevented players from returning to their original path.

## Resolution (May 15, 2025)

### Solution Implemented
The issue has been resolved by implementing a direct UI-based solution in the SpaceInfoMoves.js file. Key features of the fix:

1. **Visit-Type Aware Return Button**:
   - Added a "Return to Main Path" button that only appears for subsequent visits to PM-DECISION-CHECK
   - First visits do not show the return button, as expected by design
   - The button dynamically displays the name of the space the player will return to

2. **Intelligent Return Space Detection**:
   - The solution identifies the correct original space using a multi-layered approach:
     - First tries to use player.previousPosition
     - Then looks for stored originalSpaceId in player properties
     - Has fallback mechanisms to ensure reliable operation

3. **CHEAT-BYPASS Handling**:
   - Properly handles the CHEAT-BYPASS "point of no return" case
   - Return button is not shown if player has used CHEAT-BYPASS

4. **Consistent with Game Architecture**:
   - Leverages the existing component system and mixin architecture
   - Follows closed system principles with direct storage of game state
   - Includes proper logging and debugging capabilities

### Implementation Details
The solution was implemented in SpaceInfoMoves.js, taking advantage of the fact that this component is reliably executed, as confirmed by the console logs. This approach was chosen over modifications to the MoveLogic* files due to initialization and execution order issues with those components.

The implementation focuses on the specific issue at hand without attempting to modify complex game mechanics or multiple files, making it a targeted and maintainable solution.

### Testing
The fix has been tested to verify:
- First visits to PM-DECISION-CHECK do not show a return button
- Subsequent visits show the appropriate "Return to Main Path" button
- Clicking the return button successfully takes the player back to their original space
- The CHEAT-BYPASS option properly disables the return functionality

## Technical Analysis of Previous Attempts

### Core Problem Identified
The root issue was in the execution flow:
- MoveLogicPmDecisionCheck.js and MoveLogicSpecialCases.js weren't consistently executing when expected
- Console logs showed no evidence of the custom handlers being called
- The fixes being applied in those files weren't taking effect due to initialization order issues

### Solution Strategy
The successful strategy was to:
1. Focus on a component that was demonstrably working (SpaceInfoMoves.js)
2. Implement a direct UI solution that didn't depend on complex initialization sequences
3. Keep the code simple and focused on the specific issue
4. Add robust error handling and fallbacks

This approach allowed us to bypass the initialization issues while still providing the needed functionality to players.

## Recommendations for Future Development

1. **Review Initialization Order**:
   - The game would benefit from a more deterministic initialization system
   - Consider implementing a dependency resolver for JavaScript modules

2. **Component Communication**:
   - Improve the event system to make cross-component communication more reliable
   - Add more debugging options to verify component execution

3. **Special Case Handling**:
   - Consider refactoring special case logic to be more directly tied to UI components
   - Simplify the layers of abstraction for game mechanics

4. **Code Organization**:
   - Continue the trend toward smaller, more focused components
   - Add more robust testing for special game conditions
