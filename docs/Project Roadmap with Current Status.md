# Updated Project Roadmap

## Project Overview
A digital board game that simulates the lifecycle of a construction project. The game is designed for educational purposes, targeting colleges and universities as a teaching tool for project management concepts.

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core Movement System
**Goal**: Create a reliable, playable board game with basic movement mechanics.

- **Tasks**:
  - [x] Create simplified board with connected spaces following the "snake" diagram
  - [x] Implement player token movement between spaces
  - [x] Add basic turn system that works with multiple players
  - [x] Create simple player setup screen
  - [x] Implement game state persistence (save/load)
  - [x] Add basic end game condition
  - [x] Add comprehensive instructions panel
  - [x] Enhance space information display
  
- **Current Status**:
  - Board display and snake layout are fully implemented
  - Player movement is functional and optimized
  - Turn system works correctly for multiple players
  - Player setup interface is complete
  - Game state persistence works with localStorage
  - End game detection and scoring are implemented
  - Instructions panel shows all game data from CSV
  - Space info panel displays all relevant field information

### Phase 1+: Enhanced Movement System
**Goal**: Implement visit tracking and improved space connections.

- **Tasks**:
  - [x] Add player visit history tracking
  - [x] Implement detection for first vs. subsequent visits
  - [x] Update space connections to work with visit types
  - [x] Improve space finding logic for more reliable movement
  - [x] Document the visit tracking system
  - [x] Filter instruction spaces from the game board
  - [x] Ensure players start on the correct space
  
- **Current Status**:
  - Player visit history tracking is fully implemented
  - The game correctly shows different content for first vs. subsequent visits
  - Space connections now work properly with the visit type ID system
  - Movement between spaces is reliable and intuitive
  - START spaces are properly filtered from the board
  - Players correctly start on the OWNER-SCOPE-INITIATION space

### Phase 2: Card System
**Goal**: Implement the resource cards that drive the game's economy.

- **Tasks**:
  - [ ] Create card display component that efficiently shows cards in player's hand
  - [ ] Implement expandable "card drawer" for detailed viewing
  - [ ] Add all card types (W, B, I, L, E)
  - [ ] Connect card drawing to specific board spaces
  - [ ] Implement basic card actions (draw, discard, play)
  - [ ] Create resource tracking for player stats

- **Current Status**:
  - Card CSV data is prepared and available
  - Card logic implementation is next focus
  - Ready to begin implementation after completion of Phase 1+

### Phase 3: Dice and Outcomes
**Goal**: Implement the dice rolling mechanism and connect it to game outcomes.

- **Tasks**:
  - [ ] Create simplified dice rolling mechanic
  - [ ] Connect dice outcomes to space-specific results
  - [ ] Implement negotiation mechanic to retry outcomes
  - [ ] Add branching path logic based on dice results
  - [ ] Balance outcome probability for engaging gameplay

- **Current Status**:
  - Not started
  - Dice data CSV is available

### Phase 4: Project Management Elements
**Goal**: Enhance the educational value by implementing project management concepts.

- **Tasks**:
  - [ ] Refine board spaces to clearly represent project phases
  - [ ] Add educational tooltips explaining PM concepts
  - [ ] Implement realistic project constraints (time, budget, scope)
  - [ ] Create meaningful decision points that reflect real project challenges
  - [ ] Balance difficulty for educational value

- **Current Status**:
  - Not started
  - Some educational content is defined in space descriptions

### Phase 5: Polishing and Testing
**Goal**: Refine the user experience and gather feedback.

- **Tasks**:
  - [ ] Enhance visual design for clarity and engagement
  - [ ] Implement the "Pokedex"-style card reference system
  - [ ] Add basic animations and feedback
  - [ ] Conduct playtests with target audience
  - [ ] Create tutorial and documentation
  - [ ] Prepare marketing materials for educational institutions

- **Current Status**:
  - Not started

## Current Implementation Status

### Completed
- Basic project structure is in place
- Game board rendering with snake layout
- Player setup and turn management
- Space navigation and movement
- Game state persistence
- End game detection and display
- Visit tracking and first/subsequent visit differentiation
- Improved space connection logic
- Instructions panel with comprehensive game information
- Enhanced space information display with all CSV data
- Proper START space filtering from the board
- Correct player starting position

### In Progress
- Preparing for Phase 2 implementation (Card System)
- Collecting feedback on current implementation
- Planning for future enhancements

### Success Criteria Status
- [x] Players can play through a complete game from start to finish
- [x] The board movement system works reliably
- [x] Multiple players can take turns effectively
- [x] Game state persists when refreshing the page
- [x] End game condition is properly detected
- [x] Different content is shown for first vs. subsequent visits
- [x] Space connections work correctly with the visit type ID system
- [x] Instructions are accessible and comprehensive
- [x] All CSV data is properly displayed and utilized

This updated roadmap reflects the current state of the project and provides a clear path forward for development. The focus should now shift to implementing Phase 2 with the card system.
