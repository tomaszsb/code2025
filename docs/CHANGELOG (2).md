## May 27, 2025 - Phase 2: Structured Dice Outcomes Implementation

### Added
- **DiceOutcomeParser.js** - New parser for structured dice outcome format
- **DiceRoll_Structured.csv** - Sample structured dice outcome data
- **Phase 2 Integration** - Updated DiceRollLogic.js to use structured parser with legacy fallback
- **Enhanced InitializationManager** - Now loads both structured and legacy dice formats
- **Structured Outcome Processing** - New _processStructuredOutcomes method in DiceRollLogic

### Changed
- **DiceRollLogic.js** - Now tries structured parser first, falls back to legacy
- **InitializationManager.js** - Loads DiceRoll_Structured.csv alongside legacy format
- **Index.html** - Added DiceOutcomeParser.js script loading

### Technical Details
- **Outcome Types Supported**: DrawCards, MoveToSpace, MoveToChoice, Time, Fee, Quality, Multiplier, CardAction
- **Backward Compatibility**: Full fallback to legacy format if structured data unavailable
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when structured parsing fails
- **Data Format**: Expanded rows with SpaceName, VisitType, DiceValue, OutcomeType, OutcomeValue, Description

### Benefits
- **Easier Parsing**: Clear separation of outcome types eliminates complex regex parsing
- **Better Maintainability**: Game designers can modify outcomes without touching code
- **Improved Performance**: Structured data reduces parsing overhead
- **Enhanced Debugging**: Clear logging shows which parser is being used

### Next Steps
- Convert remaining dice outcomes to structured format
- Test with all space types
- Implement Phase 3: Movement Relationship Mapping

## May 23, 2025 - PM-DECISION-CHECK Movement Bug Fix

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL BUG**: Fixed original space tracking in MovementCore.js _updateVisitHistory method
- **Root Cause**: Code was checking for moves TO 'side quest' spaces, but PM-DECISION-CHECK is marked as 'Special'
- **Refined Fix**: Changed logic to specifically detect main path → PM-DECISION-CHECK transitions  
- **Impact**: Resolves all three reported PM-DECISION-CHECK bugs:
  - Bug 1: Main path tracking now correctly shows ARCH-SCOPE-CHECK as original space
  - Bug 2: Quest path detection now correctly identifies when coming from side quest  
  - Bug 3: Available moves now include OWNER-DECISION-REVIEW and {ORIGINAL_SPACE} replacements
- **Changes**: 
  - Modified condition to `space.name === 'PM-DECISION-CHECK' AND previousSpace.Path === 'main'`
  - Added safety check to only store originalSpaceId if not already stored
  - Removed conflicting logic from SpaceInfoMoves.js that was also trying to store originalSpaceId
- **Files**: 
  - D:\Unravel\Current_Game\code2025\js\utils\movement\MovementCore.js
  - D:\Unravel\Current_Game\code2025\js\components\SpaceInfoMoves.js
- **Testing**: Verification needed for complete resolution of all three bugs

## December 2024 - CSV Format Improvements Phase 1 (In Progress)

### Added
- **Path column** to Spaces.csv to categorize spaces (Main, Special, Side quest money/scope/cheat)
- **RequiresDiceRoll column** to Spaces.csv with Yes/No values for each space
- **{ORIGINAL_SPACE} placeholder** support in movement system for dynamic move replacement
- **FILE_STRUCTURE_REORGANIZATION.md** - Plan to clean up confusing util folder structure
- **CURRENT_STATE_SUMMARY.md** - Accurate documentation of current project state
- **PM_DECISION_CHECK_STATUS.md** - Detailed implementation status for PM-DECISION-CHECK fix

### Changed  
- **Replaced "RETURN TO YOUR SPACE"** with {ORIGINAL_SPACE} placeholder in PM-DECISION-CHECK Space 4
- **MovementCore.js** now tracks space paths using Path column and stores originalSpaceId when entering side quests
- **MovementLogic.js** now detects and replaces {ORIGINAL_SPACE} with moves from player's original space
- **SpaceInfoMoves.js** simplified to use Path column instead of hardcoded space lists
- **CSV_FORMAT_IMPROVEMENTS_IMPLEMENTATION.md** corrected to show Phase 1 in progress (not completed)
- **README.md** updated with accurate project status

### Fixed
- **Documentation/Reality Mismatch** - Corrected false claims about completed features
- **PM-DECISION-CHECK Return Logic** - Now uses data-driven approach with {ORIGINAL_SPACE} placeholder

### Notes
- Phase 1 was previously marked as completed in May 2025, but the CSV changes weren't actually made
- Now properly implementing the CSV-driven approach as originally designed
- Testing still needed to verify PM-DECISION-CHECK functionality
