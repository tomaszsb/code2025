## [2.4.2] - June 20, 2025 - Time Display Consistency Fix

### üîß **TIME DISPLAY FIXES COMPLETED**

#### **Panel Time Display Consistency (RESOLVED)**
- **Fixed time display inconsistency** across game panels - Right panel now shows space time requirement instead of player time resource
- **Clarified panel purposes** - Left panel shows player status, middle/right panels show space requirements
- **Corrected data source access** - PlayerInfo now accesses GameState.spaces instead of non-existent spacesData

**Technical Impact:**
- Left panel (StaticPlayerStatus): Shows player's accumulated time resource (e.g., "0 days")
- Middle panel (SpaceInfo): Shows current space time requirement (e.g., "1 day") 
- Right panel (PlayerInfo): Shows current space time requirement (e.g., "1 day")

**Files Modified:**
- `js/components/PlayerInfo.js` - Updated to show space time instead of player time, fixed data source reference
- `js/components/StaticPlayerStatus.js` - Verified correct display of player time resource

**Architecture Clarification:**
- **Data Access Architecture Resolved** - GameState and GameStateManager are aliases (same object)
- **Evidence** - Line 1687 in GameStateManager.js: `window.GameState = window.GameStateManager;`
- **Result** - No data inconsistency issues, just coding style preference

## [2.4.1] - June 20, 2025 - Card Button Duplication Fix

### üîß **CRITICAL FIX COMPLETED**

#### **Card Drawing Button Logic (RESOLVED)**
- **Fixed duplicate card buttons** in SpaceInfoDice.js - Dice outcomes were creating manual buttons for automatic actions
- **Separated display from interaction** - Dice outcomes now display-only, manual space buttons remain interactive
- **Eliminated card duplication pathway** - Players can no longer manually draw cards that dice already drew automatically

**Technical Impact:**
- Dice outcomes show what happened automatically without creating clickable buttons
- Manual card buttons only appear for space CSV fields that dice didn't affect
- Proper separation between automatic dice actions and manual space actions

**Files Modified:**
- `js/components/SpaceInfoDice.js` - Removed button rendering from dice outcomes display (lines 199-213)

---

## [2.4.0] - June 18, 2025 - CSV Field Fixes & Component Rendering

### üîß **CRITICAL FIXES COMPLETED**

- **Fixed missing movement buttons** in current space panel - GameBoard now properly calculates availableMoves for current space
- **Fixed visit tracking system** in GameStateManager.js - Corrected `currentSpace.name` ‚Üí `currentSpace.space_name` field references

**Technical Impact:**
- Space Explorer now shows complete content (Event, Action, Outcome, Cards, Movement Choices)
- Current space panel displays full information with clickable movement buttons
- Proper First/Subsequent space content based on player visit history
- Visit tracking system restored - players see correct space versions

#### **Game Initialization Improvements (RESOLVED)**
- **Removed 800ms delays** from PlayerSetup.js - Game starts immediately after "Start Game" button
- **Added loading messages** during game initialization - Better user feedback during transition
- **Fixed emergency fallback logic** in MovementEngine.js - FINISH spaces properly handled as game end

**Technical Impact:**
- Immediate game start response (no more blank screen delay)

- Proper game ending behavior when players reach FINISH spaces

### üìä **Field Name Standardization**

#### **Component-CSV Alignment**
- **SpaceExplorer.js**: `description` ‚Üí `Event`, `action` ‚Üí `Action`, `outcome` ‚Üí `Outcome`
- **SpaceInfo.js**: `description` ‚Üí `Event`, `action` ‚Üí `Action`, `outcome` ‚Üí `Outcome` 
- **Card fields**: `'W Card'` ‚Üí `'w_card'`, `'B Card'` ‚Üí `'b_card'`, etc.
- **GameStateManager.js**: All `currentSpace.name` ‚Üí `currentSpace.space_name`

#### **Visit Type Resolution**
- **BoardRenderer.js**: Added visit type detection for selectedSpaceObj lookup
- **SpaceSelectionManager.js**: Added visit type detection for space exploration clicks
- **Consistent logic**: Both current space and exploration use same visit type resolution

### üêõ **Debug Code Cleanup**

## üîß **Critical Development Fixes (Historical)**

### **CSV Standardization and Movement Engine Fix (Post-Phase 4)**
**Issue**: After CSV standardization, three critical problems emerged:
1. Missing dice roll button on OWNER-SCOPE-INITIATION
2. Missing card pickup functionality  
3. Wrong next move (showing CON-INITIATION instead of OWNER-FUND-INITIATION)

**Root Cause**: Inconsistent CSV column mapping in GameStateManager after standardization

**Solution**: Fixed GameStateManager.js to properly map CSV headers to consistent snake_case properties

**Key Changes**:
- Fixed CSV column references for card data (w_card, b_card, etc.)
- Standardized all space movement data to use snake_case (space_1, space_2, etc.)
- Removed duplicate/inconsistent property mappings
- Ensured MovementEngine receives proper space data with space_1 = "OWNER-FUND-INITIATION"

### **End Turn Button and Space Display Issues (January 2025)**
**Issue**: After CSV standardization, End Turn button was not properly loading next spaces, and spaces would appear briefly then disappear

**Root Causes**: 
1. Property name mismatches: `currentSpace.name` vs `currentSpace.space_name` in MovementEngine
2. Space lookup inconsistencies: `space.id` vs `space.space_name` in UI components
3. Move ID vs space name mismatches in move selection
4. React setState race conditions overwriting `exploredSpace` state

**Solution**: Comprehensive property name standardization and state preservation

**Key Changes**:
- **MovementEngine.js**: Fixed all `currentSpace.name` references to `currentSpace.space_name`
- **TurnManager.js**: Fixed space lookup to use `space.space_name` instead of `space.id`
- **SpaceSelectionManager.js**: Fixed move validation and space lookups to use correct property names
- **BoardSpaceRenderer.js**: Fixed available move checking to use `move.name` instead of `move.id`
- **SpaceSelectionManager.js**: Fixed all setState calls to preserve existing state with spread operator

### **Worktype Card Scope Display Fix**
**Issue**: Worktype (W) cards were not displaying as scope in the current turn panel (StaticPlayerStatus component)

**Root Cause**: StaticPlayerStatus was using legacy field names for card properties

**Solution**: Updated field name mapping to match current CSV format

**Key Changes**:
- **StaticPlayerStatus.js**: Updated card type check to include both `card.type` and `card.card_type`
- **StaticPlayerStatus.js**: Updated work type field to use `card.work_type_restriction` with legacy fallback
- **StaticPlayerStatus.js**: Updated cost field to use `card.work_cost` with legacy fallback

### **State Management Race Condition Prevention**
**Issue**: Multiple React setState calls were overwriting important state like `exploredSpace`

**Solution**: Changed all setState calls to use function form with prevState spread

**Pattern Applied**:
```javascript
// Before (overwrites state):
this.gameBoard.setState({ availableMoves: [], showDiceRoll: false });

// After (preserves state):
this.gameBoard.setState(prevState => ({ 
  ...prevState, 
  availableMoves: [], 
  showDiceRoll: false 
}));
```

**Components Fixed**: SpaceSelectionManager event handlers and state updates

### **Property Name Standardization Rules**
Moving forward, all components must use:
- **Space Objects**: `space.space_name` (not `space.name`)
- **Move Objects**: `move.name` for space name, `move.id` for generated ID
- **Card Objects**: Both `card.card_type` and `card.type` for type checking
- **Card Fields**: Current CSV names (`work_type_restriction`, `work_cost`) with legacy fallbacks
- **React setState**: Always use function form with spread operator to preserve state

### **App.js State Management Fix**
**Issue**: Empty page after "Start New Game" due to incorrect state references

**Solution**: Updated App.js to use GameStateManager instead of legacy GameState

**Added**: Proper event listeners for game state changes and re-render triggers

### **GameStateManager Initialization**
**Added**: `gameStarted` getter property for proper state access

**Fixed**: Initialization flag setting when first player is added

**Enhanced**: Event-driven state updates for UI synchronization
